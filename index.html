        <h1>This is a Crypto Debit Card Built by Lemon, an Argentinian Startup</h1>
        <h2>What's the Point?</h2>
        <p>Argentinians struggle with currency depreciation. In other words, the currency they are paid with tends to crash in value, eroding their buying power.</p>
        <p>Lemon thinks stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency such as the US dollar, can help.</p>

        <h2>Explanation from Lemon's CFO, Maxi Raimondi</h2>
        <blockquote>
            "It’s like any prepaid Visa card that you can use at any physical or digital store around the world that accepts Visa. <br><br> The difference is that your money is stored in your Lemon account, in the cryptocurrency you choose, such as USDC
            (a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar). When you buy something at your local bakery, we convert your USDC to local peso using a real-time exchange rate.<br><br> The merchant is paid in peso, but your money has been sitting in USDC until the
            very last moment. It thus hasn’t suffered any drastic drop in worth.<br><br> You might ask what exchange rate we use. That’s a good question, since Argentina is known for having over 20 exchange rates.<br><br> Lemon uses the Blue Chip Swap
            rate, which is calculated through a byzantine mechanism. In short: Argentinians buy US bonds in pesos and resell those bonds in dollars. An implied exchange rate is extrapolated.<br><br> While imperfect, we find this rate to be more accurate
            than both the government exchange rate and black market exchange rates."
        </blockquote>
